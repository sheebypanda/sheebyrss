## Description

This is a simple RSS feed reader. You submit RSS feed, and it displays articles sorted by date in a nice bootstrap cards view.
Like Google Now cards.

## Why ?
I can't stand informing myself by social networks. They choose for you what you need to know. And I hate sponsored content like online RSS readers do.

## TODO

 * Scroll down auto load next page
 * add delete user power for admin
 * solve HTTP redirection problem
