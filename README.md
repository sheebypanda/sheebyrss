## Description

This is a simple RSS feed reader. You submit RSS feed, and it displays articles sorted by date in a nice bootstrap cards view.
Like Google Now cards.

## Why ?
I can't stand informing myself by social networks. They choose for you what you need to know. And I hate sponsored content like online RSS readers do.

## TODO

 * admin page with user list
 * Limit sources by user
 * Limit articles by sources
 * Ajaxify the index view (display 10 articles, and auto load more when scrolled down)
